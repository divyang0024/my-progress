-- UPDATE cats set age=14 where name = 'misty';

-- UPDATE cats set name='jack' where name='jackson';

-- UPDATE cats set breed='British Shorthair' where name='ringo';

-- UPDATE cats set age=12 where breed='maine coon'; in this case even though the breed value was not captilized in the same way as the data present in the cat table but it was able to incorporate changes in it beacuse by default it is 'case insensitive'.
