    <h1>Cost of masks and tests deepens a pandemic wedge between the haves and the have-nots</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In recent weeks, as the omicron variant spread rapidly across the United States, Americans have found that the
        financial costs of the pandemic are increasingly falling on their shoulders.<br>

        As <mark>Covid-19</mark> cases have climbed, public health experts have urged people to dump their cloth masks
        in favor of higher-quality options and to test more frequently to curb the virus.<br>

        The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday updated its mask guidance to note that the disposable
        N95 or KN95 masks offer the "highest level of protection" against the virus.<br>

        For some, the added financial burden is an irritation â€” but still affordable. To others, the prospect of paying
        $1 for a single disposabl<br>e mask or $24 for a test kit is an economic impossibility, raising the specter that
        the pandemic will continue to exacerbate inequalities.<br></p>
